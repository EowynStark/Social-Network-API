## Description 
This application is the back-end framework that would provide a substantial functionality for a social media application of any visual format. It is designed to allow the client to connect users to friends and connect comments to users with added reaction functionality.

This is the basic framework for any up and coming social media focused UI experience, and since it is a foundational piece it could help make any application behave in a sophisticated and community based way.
